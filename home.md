## Clio User Manual --- Home
Clio is a 1-5 micron imager, coronagraph, and low spectral resolution spectrometer built to exploit the unique sensitivity and resolution of deformable secondary AO systems. It was used from 2006-2011 on the MMT. In 2012, it was moved to Magellan, to be used with the MagAO system.

Clio2 was upgraded with a new 512x1024 HAWAII-1 array in May 2010. Inquiries should be made to Phil Hinz (PI) or Katie Morzinski (instrument scientist).
